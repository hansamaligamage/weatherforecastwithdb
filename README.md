# Weather forecast API app with database deployed as Azure App service and Azure SQL database
This solution is a .NET 9 Web API that interacts with a SQL Server database to manage and retrieve weather data. The backend is built using Minimal APIs, providing a concise and efficient architecture for building HTTP services. The database is implemented using a code-first approach with Entity Framework Core, allowing the schema to be generated and updated through migrations.

## Azure Deployment with Publish Profile
The solution includes a publish profile designed to automate the deployment of the application to Microsoft Azure. This profile handles the provisioning and configuration of two key Azure resources:

1. Azure App Service
   * Hosts the Web API.
   * Provides a scalable, managed environment for deploying and running the application.
   * The publish profile includes settings for build configuration, deployment mode, and resource targeting.
  
2. Azure SQL Database
     * Serves as the cloud-hosted relational database backend.
     * Automatically configured to work with the deployed Web API.
     * Connection strings and related settings are managed via app settings in the App Service.
  
By using the publish profile, the deployment process becomes seamlessâ€”developers can deploy directly from Visual Studio or the command line with minimal configuration, ensuring consistency between development and production environments.
